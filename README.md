# Terasic-DE1-Altera-Development-Board-PS-2-Keyboard-Interface
VHDL code that takes the input from a PS/2 keyboard via the PS/2 port on the Terasic DE1 Altera Development Board and displays it to the LEDs and one of the hex displays found on the board.

Provided is the Quartus II project file, VHDL file, and the pin assignments needed to run the code properly on the board.

All code is combined into one file, I could have made it neater by seperating them into appropriate modules and functions but chose to keep it simple so beginners can get easily antiquated.
